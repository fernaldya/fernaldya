### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Hello, I'm Fernaldy, an aspiring Data Engineer / ML AI Engineer with a passion for turning complex data into actionable insights and efficient data systems. I have recently completed an intensive 3-month full-time data science programme, which has been a transformative journey in solidifying my skills and knowledge in the field of data engineering and science.

ðŸ¤” On my off time, I like to learn more on Data Engineering / MLAI Stacks

## âš¡ Always keen to learn more! :snake:
